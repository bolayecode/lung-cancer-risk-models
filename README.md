# Lung Cancer Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes lung cancer risk factors using a dataset and data science techniques in R. We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and built machine learning models to identify the most important predictors of lung cancer.

## Objectives
- Explore and clean the lung cancer dataset
- Visualize key patterns and trends
- Perform statistical analysis to identify significant variables
- Build predictive models using the `caret` package
- Evaluate and compare model performance

## Tools & Libraries
- R
- caret
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- tidyr
- corrplot
- rpart, randomForest

## Key Findings
- Obesity, coughing of blood, genetic risk, and smoking showed strong correlation with lung cancer diagnosis.
- Decision trees and random forest models performed well in classification tasks.

## Results
- Accuracy scores across multiple models were compared using cross-validation.
- Visualizations revealed patterns in symptom distributions across patient classes.
